<p> Hello welcome to my blog.</p>

<h4>Hello world - Wed Dec  4 00:49:05 CET 2019</h4>

<p> This is the first entry. I made today significant progress with my blog tech.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>make deploy</code> prepares a new <code>gh-pages</code> branch commit and pushes it to github</li>
<li><code>awk/lib.awk</code> will be a common place for all shared awk functions</li>
<li><code>make build</code> supports now parsing markdown meta variables (disabled until useful)</li>
<li><code>make test</code> runs <code>make build</code> and automatically opens the browser. Super convenient especially when running <code>:!make test</code> in vim.</li>
</ul>

<p> I'm very happy with this but it's 1am and I really need to get some rest.</p>

<p> No time for updates. That unfortunately means no serious progress in the blog tech. I only improved the <code>make deploy</code> so that it commit file delete changes. It had a bug where it would commit previous file again even if it was deleted in the new version.</p>
