#### Hello world - Wed Dec  4 00:49:05 CET 2019
This is the first entry. I made today significant progress with my blog tech.

* `make deploy` prepares a new `gh-pages` branch commit and pushes it to GitHub
* `awk/lib.awk` will be a common place for all shared AWK functions
* `make build` supports now parsing markdown meta variables (disabled until useful)
* `make test` runs `make build` and automatically opens the browser. Super convenient especially when running `:!make test` in vim.

I'm very happy with this but it's 1am and I really need to get some rest.
