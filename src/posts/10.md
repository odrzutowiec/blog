Another quick update. I just felt inspired and decided to add html template to my blog so I can make shorter lines and longer line spacing. Looks much better now! Also fixed the post ordering so post 10 doesn't show immidiately after post 1 but rather after post 1. And reversed the order so the latest post is at the top.

P.S. still worknig on that entry about spatial partitioning.
