My interest are in few things and those things seem to naturally intertwine and connect with each other in a complex, folded many times over manner. Every time I learn something new	on the edge of my area of interest I discover entirely new locus of meaning which connects in new, surprising and complex ways with the existing body of knowledge making the entire model even more convoluted. I developed an interest in systems via programming. There are many different systems at different levels. On other such system is social dynamics in professional context. And generally in any context. Recently I came across the Gervais Principle. It's an amazing, engineering model of social dynamics of commercial organizations.

I am in shock. It made me understand so many before inexplicable evenest I have experienced. I was intuitively half aware of some small portion of this model, but having it all laid out like that clearly and comprehensively opens my eyes. At first I was furious. I felt cheated like a complete idiot. I was the Clueless. I have now wide open maneuvering field. I just need to decide what I want. (This last part may be more difficult then it sounds)
