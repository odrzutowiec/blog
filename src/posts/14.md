My interest are in few things and those things seem to naturally intertwine and connect with each other in a complex, folded many times over manner. Every time I learn something new	on the edge of my area of interest I discover entirly new locus of meaning which connects in new, surprising and complex ways with the existing body of knoweledge making the entire model even more convoluted. I developed an interest in systems via programming. There are many differnt systems at different levels. On other such system is social dynamics in professional context. And generally in any context. Recently I came across the Gervais Principle. It's an amazing, engineering model of social dynamics of comercial organisations.

I am in shock. It made me understand so many before unexplainable evenets I have experienced. I was intuitively half aware of some small partion of this model, but having it all layed out like that clearly and comprehensively opens my eyes. At first I was furious. I felt cheated like a complete idiot. I was the Clueless. I have now wide open manuvering field. I just need to decide what I want. (This last part may be more difficult then it sounds)
