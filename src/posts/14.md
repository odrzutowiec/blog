I haven't been updating my blog for a while. I've been quite busy. I've bought a Thinkpad x230 and hid my old macbook air deep in the closet never to be spoken of again. That marks a new eara. I decided to take another stab at unix-like OSes. First I was flirting with the idea of moving to BSD and learning inner working of os kernels by reading bsd kernel source code. But I think the sheer popularity of linux makes it the best investment of my time. I am now gathering resources on calssical and contemporary C and Unix as well kernel development. I was also considering learning fundamentals of electronics but I might put it back for a while.
