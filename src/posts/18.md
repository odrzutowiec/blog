I noticed that the same searching bug happens in both vi and ex modes, if the authors of nvi had any kind of common sense there is probably a piece of code uses by both vi and ex that performs the actual search. Open source developers are generally really skilled so I think it's safe to assume that.

I noticed in that vi actually uses ex's address routines for its search feature. All functions in /vi/v_search.c eventually directly or indirectly call v_exaddr(). I'm pretty sure what I am looking for is not in the /vi/ directory.

Not all of the /vi/v_search.c functions actually lead to v_exaddr(). Some lead to f_search() and b_search(), those two are defined in /common/search.c that's another potential candidate.
