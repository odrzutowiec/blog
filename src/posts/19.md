I finally decided to start hosting my own website. An idea I was toying with for decade and a half. Turns out system administration is a whole lot easier when you poses fundamental competence with unix-like shell.

* [https://michalradecki.com/blog.html](https://michalradecki.com/blog.html) is the new home for my blog.
* For the time being I'll still support [https://odrzutowiec.github.io/blog/](https://odrzutowiec.github.io/blog/) but I think I'll drop it eventually.

Since we are nowhere near the subject I want to take this oportunity to remind myself of the following distinction. Why not, my blog, my rules.

* "command line" - Is a way to describe computer interface which operates only on text entered commands
* "shell" - Is a part of unix architecture for command line
* "terminal" - Those were old computer devices eralier models reassembled typewriters, later models had CRT screens
* "terminal emulator" - Is computer software emulating a terminal device connected to a shell
