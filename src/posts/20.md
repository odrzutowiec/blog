v_exaddr() eventuall calls f_search() too. Well not directly, v_exaddr() actually calls ex_range() which calls ex_line() which calls f_search(). Point is, all roads lead to f_search. I think my next step will be to investigate how f_search actually works and if it's broken with compile flag --enabled-widechar.

I figured out the above using GDB. GDB is kind of a complex program but it does have some really nice quality of life features built in which allow me to use it without first reading the extensive info gdb manual. The help command is amazing it lets me pretty much figure things out one the go.

Oh and I updated my homepage, I refreshed and used my old experimental project with react rendering 3D html billboards via CSS transformations using three-js for 3d perspective calculations. It's quite fun I can make gifs and text and emojis and everything else HTML can do in 3D spin around. I'm thinking I should capitalize on this technology and make my real homepage based on that. It's visually quite impressive for uninitiated and technically interesting since it intentionally avoids webgl (thus can exploit all rendering capacities of standard HTML browser renderer).
