It seems like the search results in random positions even when there is no wide characters in searched file. Anyway I briefly checked out f_search(), internally executes regexec(). From what I found regexec does not support wide chars so that's potentially the issue but rather unlikely due to the symptom I mentioned above. But before it calls regexec() it does a bunch of initialization work: it calls search_init() which calls re_compile() which calls re_conv(). Apparently nvi translates for "vi regexp" to the POSIX regexp. I actually thought vi used POSIX regex syntax directly. And it pretty much does, this re_conv() function just supports the the magic characters and \<ptrn\> literal patterns (not sure what are those patterns atm).
