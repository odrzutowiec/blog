Grand success! After few days of banging my head on the wide char and regexp search problem I decided to test it in isolation. I created a simple program with few lines of c built it with gcc myself - just a new, super small project to test things out. I quickly realized that TRE supports wide char charters but not via standard regcomp() and regexec() api, it has regwcomp() and regwexec()! That was the key! I was feeding wide character strings to normal regex functions and they were getting confused. So I have now a functioning wide char version of vi using TRE for regexes!

There is still the problem with missing support for REG_STARTEND which produces false positives in some lines and matches only the first occurrence in the line (so "n" command doesn't jump to the next occurrence in the same line) but I can emulate it with the idea I was talking about in the previous post. It's somewhat annoying but I can see now that's almost back to be 100% functioning.
