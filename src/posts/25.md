I've finally finished removing all clutter from the vip's source code. From the original 612 files there are now only 172 files left. A whole lot less files to maintain and understand.

My recent effort in migrating the codebase from inhouse regexp to the TRE library served me well as hoped. I started making changes in the actual code and got more confident with GDB and debugging. I feel I'm now ready to starting introducing new features. 

Before that however, there are still few bugs to iron out which appeard after all that clutter removal. Most noticable of which is the strange error about database each time I close vip. "BDB0635 DB_CREATE must be specified to create databases." it utters unashamed each time for goodbye. I suspect that's because Vip was using db3 before and now I made it use system's version which on my system is db5. Not a big deal, vip functions most of the time normaly. Still that's the first bug to fix.
