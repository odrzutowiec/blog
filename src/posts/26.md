I updated the [readme file in vip repo]() recently, including a section with featrure ideas. Next day I randomly stumbled upon [Apple's notes on features ideas for nvi](https://opensource.apple.com/source/vi/vi-7/nvi/docs/features.auto.html). That's a good source of inspirations for features. In general I'm surprised that apple has nvi source code and it my come in useful in more ways then one.
