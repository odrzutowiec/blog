I fixed the db problem. It was simply a change in the db_open API in db5. It needs now DB_CREATE flag. Easy enough. After fixing this I discovered that the "catalog" code (probably UNIX name or name convention for internationalization) it was trying to load a file based on the LANG env var which obviously doesn't exist because I have removed the catalog directory completely. I disabled the catalog file loading with early return 1 in the loading function. I also left a TODO comment there to remember I need to clean it up since I won't be using it at all. If you are using vi-like program you can speak English, let's be reasonable.
