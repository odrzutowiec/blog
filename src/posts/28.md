I noticed today that my server is having higher amount of bandwidth usage then it should. Pretty much no one knows about it so I'd expect zero activity. but in July there was almost 0.5GB of data sent by my server. I checked out the nginx logs and it looks like I am being constantly scanned for vulnerabilities. That's pretty scary. Who knows about it? And why do they do this? I check few IPs: Russia, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, they are all over the place, obviously not using their laptops and networks directly. I have nothing of value on my server, i suspect this may be an automated scan. I'm just not sure where they learned about my domain. Anyway for now I just limited the requests to save on the server bandwidth.
