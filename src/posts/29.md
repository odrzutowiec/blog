I noticed that deleting all content of a file and then executing 'u' undo command generates another db error. After short investigation I found append() to be the reason. Nvi "logs" all changes to the open text document to be used later as history that can be traversed with "u" and ".". The append() function interanlly operates on the database. For some reason after deleting all contents in the file and then pressing "u" I get following error: "Error: unable to insert at line 0: BDB0063 DB_BUFFER_SMALL: User memory too small for return value". I suspect like with the previous bug I solved it's related to changing the Berkeley database version from 3 to 5. I downloaded the official documentation, and it's pretty extensive. I've read opinions that BDB is fairly easy in usage but it may be too much for me at the moment. I want to actually understand the problem and solve it properly and it will require of me to understand how BDB works and how to use it. I'm afraid it maybe be too much for me right now so I decided to temporarily go back to K\&R until I feel more confident with C. 

Also I just noticed the ampersand doesn't work in my blog tech. My AWK script thinks I'm trying to use a variable.
