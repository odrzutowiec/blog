I'm a little tired of `make` and `awk` at the moment so I decided to switch projects for a while. I have the template variables feature pretty much working except that for some reason when running `awk` via `make` it errors with `awk: invalid -v option` but that same exact command when run manually by pasting it in the terminal work sperfectly fine.
I've recently heard that the "health" niche is evergreen on mobile. For the last year on and off I've been working on week organiser algorithm I named GYST. I'll brush up on this project. Update all the dependencies and see if I can make some progress. Last time I stopped at having simple D3 visualisation for my genetic algorithm since I needed to understand better why doesn't my algorithm work.
