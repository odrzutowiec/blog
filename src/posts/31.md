Just a quick update. I temporarily suspended my C education. I went as far as the exercise 5-17 from K\&R and I really enjoyed it. I certainly plan to come back to that and finish the book. However currently I feel I need to educate myself with the fundamentals of computer science, particularly algorithms, system design and other interesting, useful but ultimately never in Patrice used skills that are necessary to prove oneself during a job interview... My attitude probably shows that I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand those subjects are fascinating on the other I'm not especially happy to be so rudely interrupted during my C education.
