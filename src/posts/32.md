Amazing! Yesterday I decided to have another stab at the VIP's db error. After debugging and reading some db5 documentation I randomly stumbled up the solution. The bug is now fixed marking VIP as a fully usable vi. I'll describe the bug again and it's solution for future reference.

Bug:
After deleting a line or multiple lines such that the resulting file has less lines in total the undo command that would bring back those deleted lines errored and did not bring back those deleted lines.

Analysis:
The symptopm of the the underlaying issue was a db error "BDB0063 DB_BUFFER_SMALL: User memory too small for return value" which was happening during append() which was called when bringing back those deleted lines. From what I understand after reading the documentation for DBC->put() (in the code it's DBC->c_put(), the name of the function changed in db5 but the legacy db4 naming still works) this "DB_BUFFER_SMALL" error indicates that we couldn't load the data from the database back to the memory because allocated memory is too small. 

Fix:
Changing the key's flag to DB_DBT_MALLOCK informs db that it should allocate enough memory for us. I assume that was the default behaviour in db3 and now in db5 has to be explicitly stated. This fix can potentially be introducing new memory leaks, however I'm not sure at the moment. I'll need to put the entire program through valgrind anyway.
