The VIP error turns out to be another case of REG_STARTEND flag bsd extension a for
regexec() in ex/ex_subst.c in s() function responsible for the :s command. Same issue 
as the last time with searching. This is aftermath of migrating to TRE which doesn't 
support bsd's extensions. I noticed one more case of the same flag in ex/ex_global.c
won't fix it for now since I haven't encountered that issue yet, but should be
pretty straightforward to fix it. Vip is getting better and I am getting better
at making it better.
