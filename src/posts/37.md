I've spent recently some time learning fundamentals of CMAKE and started building my first rogue-like game. That was a very exciting experience. I realize I am in a "honeymoon" period with gamedev but the feeling of making a game was more then I ever dreamed of. I felt like I've finally found my calling. This is definitely how I see my (hopefully) early retirement - making games.

Having done a basic map, a controllable character and even a vision and path-finding systems functioning (thanks to the libtcod library) I started scheming out few concepts for how I want to organize my game world. I eventually stumbled upon Pure Entity Component System design pattern and Data Oriented Design approach to programming, and among other great people I listened to what Jon Blow (Braid and The Witness), Casey Muratori (Handmade Hero) and finally Mike Acton (Unity3D's engine team lead designer) have to say on the subject. They all seem to say similar things, but Mike's talks are the most concrete and comprehensive. Over the next few posts I'll make a short summary of what I learned from Mike.
