Mike Acton's advice on how to be a professional programmer. Unsurprisingly there is a lot of overlap with the advice from the Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler which I find reassuring, since I wasn't 100% convinced to the Chad's book.

Mike has a 25 minutes talk on GDC with sentences he believes a good professional programmer should answer "yes" to. He goes into some detail on each sentence, but I believe they are mostly self explanatory.

You can watch the original talk here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV5HArLYajE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV5HArLYajE)

I organized all points into two categories: a professional, an a programmer because I feel the first category is more broad and can apply to other professions as well.

A professional

* "I can articulate precisely what problem I am trying to solve" 
* "I have actually articulated what problem I am trying to solve"
* "I have confirmed that someone else can articulate what problem I am trying solve"
* "I can articulate why my problem is important to solve"
* "I can articulate how much [of my work time] is my problem worth solving"
* "I have a Plan B in case my solution to my current problem doesn't work"
* "I have already implemented my Plan B in case my solution to my current problem doesn't work"
* "I can articulate the steps required to solve my current problem"
* "I can clearly articulate unknowns and risks associated with my current problem"
* "I have not thought or said "I can just make up the time" without immediately talking to someone"
* "I can schedule my own time well"
* "I am vigilant about not wasting other's time"
* "I actively seek constructive feedback and take it seriously"
* "I am not actively avoiding any uncomfortable (professional) conversations"
* "I am not actively avoiding any (professional) conflicts"
* "I consistently interact with other professionals, professionally"
* "I can articulate what I believe others should expect from me"
* "I don't require multiple reminders to respond to a request or complete work"
* "I pursue opportunities to return value of the commons (when appropriate)"
* "I actively work to bring value to the people I work with"
* "I actively work to ensure underrepresented voices are heard"

A programmer

* "I have sat and watched an actual user of my system"
* "I write a "framework" and have used it multiple times to actually solve a problem it was intended to solve"
* "I can articulate the test for completion of my current problem is"
* "I can articulate the hypothesis related to my problem and how I could falsify it"
* "I can articulate the most common concrete use-case of the system I am developing"
* "I know the most common actual, real-life values of the data I am transforming"
* "I can articulate what will happen when (somehow) data outside that range enters the system"
* "I can articulate a list of input data into my system roughly sorted by likelihood"
* "I know the frequency of change of the actual, real-life values of the data I am transforming"
* "I know the slowest part of the users of my system's workflow with high confidence"
* "I know what information users of my system will need to make effective use of the solution"
* "I can articulate the finite set of hardware I am designing my solution to work for"
* "I can articulate how that set of hardware specifically affects the design of my system"
* "I know how to significantly improve the performance of my system without changing the input/output interface of the system"
* "I know what data I am reading as part of my solution and where it comes from"
* "I know how often I am reading data I do not need as part of my solution"
* "I know what data I am reading as part of my solution and where it is used"
* "I know how often I am writing data I do not need to as part of my solution"
* "I can articulate how all the data I use is laid out in memory"
* "I can articulate the (various) latency requirements for my current problem"
* "I can articulate the (various) throughput requirements for my current problem"
* "I have (at least partially) read the (available) documentation for the hardware, platform and tools I use the most commonly"
* "I have recently profiled the performance of my system"
* "I have recently profiled memory usage of my system"
* "I have used multiple different profiling methods to measure the performance of my system"
* "I know specifically how I can and will debug live release builds of my work when they fail"
* "I never use the phrase "platform independent" when referring to my work"
* "I never use the phrase "future proof" when referring to my work"

I've scored myself answer "no" to all sentences I can use more practice or, so I believe it was a pretty harsh judgment on myself, anyhow I got somewhere around 15-25 points.

Funny thing is, that there is only 49 questions yet in his scoring system Mike pranks us because only scores of 50 are not fired from his hypothetical example company. I believe what he is trying to say is that "you need to do more then those 49 things".
