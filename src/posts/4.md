I've solve it! I have now variables working in blog tech. Apparently my problem was that xargs was treating everything as one big argument instead of few separate arguments separated -v. I think internally xargs is not calling shell but rather forks the program directly and passes arguments to it via the c interface. That would explain why the command that was generated by `xargs -t` was working correctly when manually copied and pasted into the terminal but would fail when run via xargs/make.
Anyway next problem to solve in blog tech is start dynamically replace variable names from .md files into their values that were passed as arguments to awk script.
