I have come to realization that it's difficult to keep up my notes with the rate of research I'm currently doing. I'm trying to be diligent about making notes but I still keep forgetting about it. Hopefully things will change soon. Meantime currently, I have been researching [Data Oriented Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-oriented_design) for the past few days and computer memory and CPU caches, more precisely reading the famous paper named ["What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory"](https://lwn.net/Articles/250967/). This is a truly fascinating subject. Correct data layout and handling can lead to 10x performance improvements in program execution. The most naive heuristic would be something along the lines of "Keep data homogeneous, aligned and densely packed into arrays and prefer structure of arrays over array of structures".
