Finally some progress with VIP. Not as much as I would like but finally something noteworthy. I just finished adding new option "spacetabs". It works similarly to "expandtab" in vim. No more using external formatter before every commit at work!

Next feature will be readline in the : command mode. File and history completion, here I come!
