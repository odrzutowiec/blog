Following up on my recent win with VIP I've further modified the "spacetabs" option. It will now also convert explicitly inserted <tab> characters at the beginning of the line to tabs. Finally it works exactly how I want it. I think I have finally some vague understanding of how the input routines work in nvi. Such confusing code. Well no, the code is written quiet well, especially given when it was written, but the logic behind it is not obvious. I have not expected converting tabs to spaces will be such a challenge and will require me to understand most of the input routines in the entire program... Anyway with that knowledge it should be easier to implement readline.
