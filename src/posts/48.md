I guess it's time for another update. I haven't been posting much lately. I spent an entire "hack week" at work working on VIP, trying to replace the internal :command routines with readline. It's almost done, but not quite polished enough for me to use it yet. I've learned a lot about the how nvi handles io, a lot about readline and few things about curses. All great. But after this I felt I'm getting behind with the rough planning I had for this year. I've been neglecting learning TeX and spending time working on VIP instead.

I've decided to change my planning. My original plan for the next two years was: read The TeX Book, then read Basic Mathematics, then read CLRS and spend a lot of time practicing algorithms. My current plan is: just practice a lot of algorithms and maybe read up some things in CLRS, ignore math or TeX for now. That way I will have more superficial knowledge so I'm taking a sort of "learning dept" but I'm hoping I'll be able to pay it back and learn everything deeply once I reach my big goal. My big goal is of course working only 2 weeks per month and having the other two weeks absolutely free so that I can dedicate that time to learning and personal projects. I'm hoping that will propel me into a positive feedback loop of learning which will then elevate me into exponentially higher level of skills. A bootstrapping process.
