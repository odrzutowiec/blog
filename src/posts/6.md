I've been busy with the hackathon held by my employer for the last few days so I couldn't really spend any time on personal projects. I managed to prepare PoC that it is possible to separate one of the major functionalities in our project into a separate project. This will decouple two teams and let each team has their own repository. I don't think I have to explain how far reaching positive effects this may have. It's a big win for me, my team, the other team and company in general. I hope I can follow up on this project afterwards and make the PoC into reality. Anyhow I feel pretty tired and bored with programming at the moment. Especially writing POSIX compliant scripts using sh, find, grep, sed and awk is quite difficult. I find POSIX versions of those utilities are really bare bones and often lack quality of life features. You can usually substitute those lacking features with just more scripts but in the heat of the moment like during a hackathon this can mean life or death. I imagine if I'd strictly stick with POSIX I'd build up a library of those convenience functions, but it will take time.
