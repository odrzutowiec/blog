Recently I've been thinking more about computer graphics. Specifically about the 3D projection matrix and the occlusion culling techniques (based on BSP and octrees). I just found this awesome website with exhaustive and well explained 3D fundamentals https://www.scratchapixel.com/ (no occlusion culling though). 

Did I mention I'd love to make a living owning a bike repair shop while making indie games? I don't have a thing for bikes, but they represent to me a different, slower kind of life. I'm 28 and even though I get bored with games much faster now and usually have enough after a one hour play session I still have in me 2 consecutive three hour play sessions every now and then. Not to mention how much actual time I spend consuming gaming content on youtube and the web (I should read more https://www.gamasutra.com/ though). I believe games are my biggest passion in life. There is something about the immersive escapism and world building that truly appeals to me.
